T02: Python Basics
=====

Why use Python?
----------------

Python is a versatile high-level programming language. It is free, unlike MATLAB, and packages are open-source, which means that anybody can use and change Python tools. Python is ideal for manipulating data in dataframes, performing statistical analyses, and creating plots and graphs (including interactive ones). It is also very useful in machine learning and image analysis. Because of its intuitive and easy-to-read syntax, Python is a good language for programming beginners.

Python vs. R
----------------

Python and R are the languages of choice for data scientists. Many scientists use R for data cleaning and visualization because it has been optimized for statistical analysis and data visualization. Python, on the other hand, is a general-purpose language with more functionality and is better suited to writing engineering-based pipelines. Python allows greater flexibility in reading data from different file formats and is easier to customize because of its clear syntax.
