Python is ideal for manipulating data in dataframes (a type of data table), performing statistical analyses, and creating plots and graphs (including interactive ones). It is also very useful in machine learning and image analysis. Because of its intuitive and easy-to-read syntax, Python is a good language for programming beginners.
