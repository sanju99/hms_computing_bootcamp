T03: Dataframe Manipulation
=====

Dataframes
----------------

Dataframes are tables that represent data in an easy-to-read two-dimensional format. They are used in both Python and R and are incredibly useful to scientists. In Python, dataframes are manipulated using a package called ``pandas``, which is imported like any other package.

>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import numpy as np

From there, we can create and modify dataframes with functions from the package. Let's start by reading in a dataset and doing some basic manipulations. This will also require ``numpy`` functions, so make sure this package is also installed, like above.

Pandas can read in data in many formats -- comma-separated (CSV), tab-separated (TSV), Excel, XML, etc. The most common ones you will use are probably CSV and Excel. Make sure you have the most up to date version of ``pandas`` because the ``read_excel`` file was added recently.
